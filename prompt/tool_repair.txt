Your tool call was invalid or used an unsupported tool name.
Re-emit ONLY one corrected one-line JSON tool call.
Rules:
- Use "tool":"run" for shell commands OR "tool":"write" for creating files
- Use a single line of JSON with double quotes for keys/values
- Escape any double quotes inside strings, or use single quotes in shell commands
- For newlines in file content, use \n (e.g., "line1\nline2")
- Do not include extra braces, extra lines, or any other text
Examples:
{"tool":"run","cmd":"find . -type f -name '*.js' -print"}
{"tool":"write","path":"hello.js","content":"console.log('Hello');"}
